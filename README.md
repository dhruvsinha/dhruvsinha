### About Me

I am thrilled to be pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and Public Policy from the University of Chicago, building on the strong foundation in Economics, Mathematics, and Computer Science that I developed during my undergraduate studies at Ashoka University in New Delhi. Through my coursework in economics, statistics, machine learning, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence policy, I have gained a solid foundation in using technology to solve wide range social and financial problems that our is facing.

At the University of Chicago, I am learning advanced techniques for modeling and analyzing data to create innovative solutions for important social concerns. I am passionate about leveraging technology to create positive change in society, and I am excited to use my skills to tackle real-world problems.

I am set to graduate in May 2023 and am actively seeking full-time opportunities in Data Science and Data Engineering in the US. Please feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhruvsinha1998/) to learn more about my experience and qualifications.


### Current Work
I am currently working part-time as a Machine Learning Researcher at the Data, Infrastructure, Computation, and Environments ([DICE](https://dice.cs.depaul.edu/))  Lab in Chicago. At DICE, I am designed  a deep learning model that utilizes bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to predict points of errors in the application that fails to complete a test run on containers. By analyzing the sequence of system calls, the model estimates the point of divergence between a successful and an unsuccessful run of the application. This significantly reduces the time complexity for error detection, from exponential to linear.

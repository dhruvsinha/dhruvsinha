### About Me

I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science and Public Policy from the University of Chicago. I finished my undergraduate in 2020 from Ashoka University in New Delhi, where I studied Economics, Mathematics, and Computer Science. Through my coursework in economics, statistics, machine learning, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence policy, I have gained a solid foundation in using technology to address complex social issues. At UChicago, I am learning exactly what I want to learn- quantitatively modeling of data to devise models that solve important social concerns. Please feel free to connect with me over linkeIn

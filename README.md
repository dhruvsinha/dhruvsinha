## Hi, I'm DhruvðŸ‘‹

### About Me
I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Oak Street Health, CVS in Chicago. I work on disease prediction pipelines and developing advanced AI tools like GPT-4-based REACT agents for efficient healthcare document analysis. 

I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Computational Analysis and Public Policy from The University of Chicago and a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics and Computer Science from Ashoka University. My academic and professional journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in economics, machine learning, cloud computing, and AI policy, enabling me to solve a wide range of technical and societal challenges.

At the intersection of technology and social impact, I am passionate about leveraging data science and machine learning to drive equitable, innovative solutions to real-world problems.


### Current Work
In my current role at Oak Street Health, I:

* **Developed AI Governance Frameworks**: Integrated fairness metrics into disease prediction pipelines, proactively addressing biases across race, gender, and location.
* **Streamlined Healthcare Information Retrieval**: Worked on building a GPT-4-powered REACT agent to extract relevant details on specific diseases from patient documents, enhancing decision-making for healthcare teams.

In my prior roles, I contributed to:

* Building dynamic dashboards for health equity analysis using SQL and Python.
* Automating transcription accuracy assessments with Hugging Face Transformers to improve vendor evaluations.
* Designing deep learning-based debugging tools to optimize error detection for containerized applications.

I also run a non-profit initiative, **Paricharcha Education Foundation**, where I design and teach critical thinking, speaking, and writing curricula in Hindi for children.

### About Me

I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science and Public Policy from the University of Chicago. I finished my undergraduate in 2020 from Ashoka University in New Delhi, where I studied Economics, Mathematics, and Computer Science. Through my coursework in economics, statistics, machine learning, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence policy, I have gained a solid foundation in using technology to address complex social issues. At UChicago, I am learning exactly what I want to learn- quantitatively modeling of data to devise models that solve important social concerns. You can connect with me over [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhruvsinha1998/). 


### Current Work
I am currently working part-time as a Machine Learning Researcher at the Data, Infrastructure, Computation, and Environments ([DICE](https://dice.cs.depaul.edu/))  Lab in Chicago. At DICE, I am designed  a deep learning model that utilizes bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to predict points of errors in the application that fails to complete a test run on containers. By analyzing the sequence of system calls, the model estimates the point of divergence between a successful and an unsuccessful run of the application. This significantly reduces the time complexity for error detection, from exponential to linear.

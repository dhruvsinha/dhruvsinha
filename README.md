## Hi, I'm DhruvðŸ‘‹

### About Me

I am thrilled to be pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and Public Policy from the University of Chicago, building on the strong foundation in Economics, Mathematics, and Computer Science that I developed during my undergraduate studies at Ashoka University in New Delhi. Through my coursework in economics, statistics, machine learning, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence policy, I have gained a solid foundation in using technology to solve wide range social and financial problems that our is facing.

At the University of Chicago, I am learning advanced techniques for modeling and analyzing data to create innovative solutions for important social concerns. I am passionate about leveraging technology to create positive change in society, and I am excited to use my skills to tackle real-world problems.

I am set to graduate in May 2023 and am actively seeking full-time opportunities in Data Science and Data Engineering. Please feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhruvsinha1998/) to learn more about my experience and research. You can also mail me at ðŸ“« dhruvsinha.09@gmail.com


### Current Work
I am currently working part-time as a Machine Learning Researcher at the Data, Infrastructure, Computation, and Environments ([DICE](https://dice.cs.depaul.edu/))  Lab in Chicago. At DICE, I am designed  a deep learning model that utilizes bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to predict points of errors in the application that fails to complete a test run on containers. By analyzing the sequence of system calls, the model estimates the point of divergence between a successful and an unsuccessful run of the application. This significantly reduces the time complexity for error detection, from exponential to linear.

In addition to my research and academic work, I also run a small initiative called [Debate for You](debateforyou.com). At Debate for You, I teach middle school and high school students critical thinking and debate techniques that can help them navigate the increasingly complex and polarized world we live in. By encouraging students to explore multiple perspectives and form their own opinions on important social and political issues, I believe that we can help create a more engaged and informed citizenry.
